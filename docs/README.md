[User Stories](user-stories.md)
* As a barber I would find this application very useful. The first reason would be to help organize my clients, instead of every one showing up at once I 
can set a schedule. This will help minimize wait times and losing customers who are tired of waiting. I will also be able to share photos of my cuts to help attract 
new clients that may not be aware of my skills. Also being able to offer online payment options, this will help to get client in and out of the chair more quickly!

* As a client of a barber shop I would find this application very useful. Being able to see what time slots are open ahead of time helps me to set
up my day. I have a busy schedule and can not afford to wait around for hours for a hair cut. I also find this helpful if I move to a new location I can 
find barbers that are close to me. Being able to post reviews of my experience is a great feature so others can see how well certain shops
and barbers perform.
